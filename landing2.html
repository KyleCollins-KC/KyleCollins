									</div>
										<p>
											I have completed my master’s degree in chemistry, during my time as a student I was consistently recognised for academic excellence, 
											having received awards for best student in Years 1, 2, and 3. I gained valuable experience working within the Chemistry and Operations departments of a nuclear power plant, where I applied my analytical and numerical skills in a 
											real-world setting. I am proficient in Excel, MATLAB and python having completed comprehensive data and AI driven analysis during my final-year project, which I presented at the 2025 ENC-ISMAR Conference in California. 
											I am highly organised, adaptable, proactive in embracing new challenges and thrive in a fast-paced hands-on collaborative environment. I am eager to leverage my technical knowledge to develop innovative solutions.
