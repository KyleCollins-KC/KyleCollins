                                            So, beyond my CV and my background in Chemistry, who am I? I thrive on learning new skills, often independently but never hesitate to seek guidance from those with more experience. This website is a product of that; it started as an idea, and after researching how to build it, here we are.<br>
                                            I’m currently working on various projects in my free time, including developing a chatbot powered by multiple AI agents to enhance its functionality, such as web scraping. But my interests extend far beyond computers.

                                        <h3 id="content">More than just code</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            I have a deep love for football and play weekly. It has helped me build teamwork skills, resilience, and discipline, traits that also translate into other aspects of my life, from tackling coding challenges to refining my skills in the kitchen. Cooking and baking, like science and coding, don’t always go to plan. However, I’ve learned that adapting to unexpected outcomes can often lead to something even better than originally envisioned.
                                            <br>Take one of my baking experiences, for example, a cake I made seemed perfect on the outside, but when I cut into it, the centre was still liquid. Instead of considering it a failure, I removed the undercooked portion, transformed it into a doughnut shape, and filled the centre with berry cream. In the end, everyone loved the surprise-filled dessert, proof that setbacks can lead to unexpectedly great results.
                                        </p>
                                        <span class="image fit"><img src="images1/pic17.jpg" alt="" /></span>

                                        <p>
                                            However other times things go exactly as planned and here are some delicious examples of that.

										<h3 id="content">A Passion for Travel</h3>
										<p>
                                            I also love travelling and immersing myself in different cultures, whether through food or attempting to speak the local language. My favourite destination so far has been Italy, thanks to its stunning landscapes, welcoming people and of course, the food. One particularly memorable moment was in a gift shop, where two Italian women tested a perfume and exclaimed "che schifo!" (how disgusting). They laughed, and because I had picked up some Italian, I also laughed while the people I was with remained oblivious.<br>
                                            It was also in Italy that I first tasted fresh pasta made by professionals. A year earlier, I had tried making it myself, but I wasn’t sure if I had done it right because it tasted so different from dried store-bought pasta. The moment I took my first bite of authentic Italian fresh pasta, I knew I had done it right all along.
                                        </p>
